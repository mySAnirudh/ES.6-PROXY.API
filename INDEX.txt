    ES6 implements intercession form of meta programming using Proxies. Similar to 
ReflectAPI, the Proxy API is another way of implementing meta programming in ES6. The 
Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations. A proxy object 
performs some operations on behalf of the real object.
The various terminologies related to ES6 proxies are given below:
Sr No Terminology Description
1 handler Placeholder object which contains traps
2 traps
The methods that provide property access. This is 
analogous to the concept of traps in operating 
systems
3 target Object which the proxy virtualizes. It is often used 
as storage backend for the proxy.
Syntax
The syntax stated below is for the Proxy API, where, target can be any sort of object like 
array, function or another proxy and handler is an object whose properties are functions. 
This defines the behavior of the proxy.
const proxy = new Proxy(target,handler)
